# 🌍 Global Energy Trends

A comprehensive Power BI dashboard and analysis project exploring global energy consumption and power generation trends across different continents and countries. This project highlights the role of renewables vs. non-renewables and identifies key insights into energy usage patterns using real-world datasets.

## 📊 Project Overview

This project was developed as part of a data analytics internship focused on Power BI. It leverages multiple datasets to perform detailed analysis and interactive visualization of global energy trends from 1997 to 2017.

### Key Objectives

- Analyze continent-wise and country-wise energy consumption in TWH.
- Compare renewable vs. non-renewable power generation across the globe.
- Highlight the top 20 countries in power generation.
- Provide interactive and informative Power BI dashboards for decision-making.

## 📁 Datasets Used

The project uses the following datasets (CSV format):

1. `Continent_Consumption_TWH.csv`  
2. `Country_Consumption_TWH.csv`  
3. `renewablePowerGeneration97-17.csv`  
4. `nonRenewablesTotalPowerGeneration.csv`  
5. `renewablesTotalPowerGeneration.csv`  
6. `top20CountriesPowerGeneration.csv`

## 📈 Key Visuals

The Power BI dashboard includes the following visuals:

- Line charts showing power generation trends over time.
- Stacked bar charts comparing renewable vs. non-renewable sources.
- Pie charts showing consumption share by continent.
- Heat maps and tree maps for regional comparisons.
- Country-level ranking visuals for top 20 contributors to power generation.
